# TasteTracker(frontend)
This is a university group project aimed at creating a website that displays restaurants within a one-mile radius of the user's location. The project focuses on the Newcastle area and currently includes a demo database with information for approximately 30 restaurants. 

## Project Overview
- This repository includes frontend codes only. 
- The project consists of a frontend part developed using React, which communicates with a backend server via API calls. 
- The frontend leverages various external libraries, including Google Map React and React Toastify.
- This project used MUI to create visually appealing components.

## Features
- **Interactive Map**: The website utilizes Google Map React to display restaurants as markers on an interactive map. Users can click on a marker to view basic information about the restaurant and easily navigate to the restaurant's dedicated page for more details.

- **Map and List Views**: The website offers the flexibility to switch between map view and list view, allowing users to choose their preferred way of exploring nearby restaurants.

- **Cuisine Filtering**: Users can filter restaurants based on cuisines in both map view and list view, helping them narrow down their options based on their culinary preferences.

- **User Authentication**: The website provides user authentication features, including registration, login, and logout. Registered users can access additional functionalities such as posting reviews for restaurants.

- **Restaurant Reviews**: Logged-in users can share their experiences by posting reviews for restaurants. This feature enables users to provide valuable feedback to the community and contribute to the restaurant discovery process.
